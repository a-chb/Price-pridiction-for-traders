Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do.
There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. psychological, rational and irrational behavior, etc.
All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.
Using Machine Learning concepts, fetching dataset and trained it using Long Sort Term Memory (LSTM) model results prediction of price of goods.

LSTMs are widely used for sequence prediction problems and have proven to be extremely effective. 
The reason they work so well is because LSTM is able to store past information that is important, and forget the information that is not. 
    
   LSTM has three gates:

    The input gate: The input gate adds information to the cell state
    The forget gate: It removes the information that is no longer required by the model
    The output gate: Output Gate at LSTM selects the information to be shown as output
    
Time series forecasting is a very intriguing field to work with, as I have realized during my time writing these articles. 
There is a perception in the community that it’s a complex field, and while there is a grain of truth in there, it’s not so difficult once you get the hang of the basic techniques.

I am interested in finding out how LSTM works on a different kind of time series problem and encourage you to try it out on your own as well. If you have any questions, feel free to connect with me in the comments section below.
